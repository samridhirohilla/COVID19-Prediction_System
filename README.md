COVID-19 has impacted lives worldwide since early 2020. This repository provides a case study analysis and prediction pipeline that:

    Visualizes the progression of confirmed cases and deaths,

    Compares trends across countries (global and India),

    Implements forecasting techniques to predict future case counts,

    Uses Jupyter Notebook to orchestrate the workflows.

The main objective is to derive useful insights from historical pandemic data and build prediction models that forecast confirmed cases and fatalities over time.
